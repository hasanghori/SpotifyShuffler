# SpotifyShuffler
This program uses JavaFX to create a desktop UI that will allow users to shuffle a playlist based on their mood.
As of right now the program takes in a playlist as a file then using the slider, the user can choose select the mood and hit addSong and the program will add a new song in a range to the queue.
Currently, the program uses a file, however the goal is to create an app that will connect to the spotify API and shuffle your playlist like that.
